# Recommendation Systems for Movies

This repository contains two movie recommendation systems implemented using different datasets. These systems demonstrate various recommendation approaches, providing personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences and historical data.

## Datasets Used

1. **TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset**  
   - Source: [TMDB (The Movie Database)](https://www.themoviedb.org/)  
   - Approach: Content-Based Recommendation System  
   - Description: Recommendations are generated by analyzing movie attributes such as genres, cast, crew, and keywords.

2. **The Movies Dataset**  
   - Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)  
   - Approaches:  
      - **Content-Based**: Similar to the TMDB system, using movie metadata to generate suggestions.  
      - **Collaborative Filtering**: Based on user interaction data (e.g., ratings) to recommend movies liked by similar users.  
      - **Hybrid**: Combines content-based and collaborative filtering approaches to enhance recommendation accuracy.

## Features

### TMDB Recommendation System
- Simple content-based filtering.
- Utilizes movie metadata (genres, keywords, cast, etc.).
- Ideal for a straightforward introduction to recommendation systems.

### The Movies Dataset Recommendation System
- **Content-Based**: Suggests similar movies based on metadata.  
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests movies based on user ratings, leveraging similarities between users.  
- **Hybrid**: Combines both methods to overcome individual limitations and improve recommendation quality.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - Pandas  
  - NumPy  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - Surprise (for collaborative filtering)  
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)  

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
2. Run the Jupyter notebooks:
    TMDB_5000.ipynb for the TMDB recommendation system.
    The_Movies_Dataset.ipynb for the multi-approach recommendation system.
   
## Results and Insights
- The TMDB Recommendation System is efficient for scenarios where only metadata is available.
- The Movies Dataset Recommendation System demonstrates the strengths of combining multiple approaches, offering more diverse and accurate recommendations.

## Future Work
- Extend collaborative filtering to include implicit feedback.
- Integrate more advanced techniques like neural collaborative filtering or deep learning-based models.
- Explore real-time recommendation deployment.
